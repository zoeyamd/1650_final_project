# 1560 Final Project - Analysis of RIPTA Ridership and On-Time Performance
**Zoey Dangleman**

This repository is focused on analyzing RIPTA ridership and on-time performance data. The primary research question of this project is: How do certain ridership variables (trip frequency, average ridership) correlate to each other and the on-time performance of the RIPTA? The motivation behind this question is to define key characteristics and patterns of route-stops in order to inform service planning strategies and investment. 

The files of this repository are organized as follows:<br>
_scripts_: folder containing files with functions<br>
_execution_: folder containing executable run script file and step-by-step instructions<br>
_test_: folder containing data + mock run script in order to illustrate how the repository is to be run/what it produces<br>

What this repository will return is:<br>
_anova test results_: summary of statistical relationship between service frequency and ridership<br>
_lm model results_: summary of the linear impact of increasing service frequency on incident occurences<br>
_ridership frequency plot_: boxplots that illustrate the distribution of ridership changes across frequency categories (visual representation of anova tests)<br>
_incident plot_: log-transformed scatterplot that shows relationship between late and early incidents<br>
These can again be used to inform service planning and to assess the effectiveness of current strategies.
