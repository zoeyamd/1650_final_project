welcome to my 1560 final project! here is how to run my code:

create a new R script file.
open run.R file located in execution folder. 
follow steps in run.R, fill in with your unique data/paths as notated.
for plotting, refer to the plotting.R file located in scripts folder. this code can be copied into the same file that you are currently working in. 
to review outputs, go to the results folder! there should be two plots in .png files, a summary table in a .csv file, as well as another summary in a .txt file. 

thank you so much for using my code! i hope the results offer valuable insight into your bus-system performance!
